# 🔐 File Integrity Checker

A simple Python GUI tool that allows users to verify file integrity using SHA-256 hashing. It can compute, display, save, and later compare file hashes to ensure files have not been altered or tampered with.

## 🛠️ Features

- 📂 Select any file using a file dialog
- 🔐 Generate a secure SHA-256 hash of the file
- 💾 Save the generated hash to a `.txt` file
- ✅ Easily check for file tampering by comparing stored hashes

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

File integrity checking is a foundational concept in cybersecurity. This project:
- Reinforces how cryptographic hashes work
- Shows how to use `hashlib` in real-world apps
- Demonstrates secure file validation and verification workflows
